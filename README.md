# Library TDD Boilerplate
This project is a boilerplate with all the basics for a project to support TDD with basic functionality.

The following resources are in use in this project:
- Typescript
- ESLint
- Enforcement of code coverage

Need to add
- Logging
- Telemetry
- ECS - Feature Flag Service

# Katas

## FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Prime Factors
In the Prime Factors kata, you write a routine that takes one argument – a positive, non-zero
integer – and returns a list of the integer’s prime factors. If the integer has no prime factors, return
an empty list. The data types of the argument and return value depend on the programming
language you are using. 

## Roman Numerals
The Roman numerals kata attempts to create a conversion mechanism from integers to a Roman representation (a string):
1, 2 and 3 become I, II and III respectively.
5 and 10 become V and X respectively.
6 become VI, as symbols are additive.
4 becomes IV, as symbols are used subtractively (in this case subtracting 1 from 5) to avoid repeating a symbol more than three times in a row.
